    <h4><i>Before the effigy of</i> Dr. KOCH, <i>who is represented
    in the act of examining a test-tube with the expression of
    bland blamelessness peculiar to Wax Models.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Well-informed Visitor</i>. That's Dr. KOCH, making his
    great discovery!</p>

    <p><i>Unscientific V.</i> What did <i>he</i> discover?</p>

    <p><i>Well-inf. V.</i> Why, the Consumption Bacillus. He's got
    it in that bottle he's holding up.</p>

    <p><i>Unsc. V.</i> And what's the good of it, now he <i>has</i>
    discovered it?</p>

    <p><i>Well-inf. V.</i> Good? Why, it's the thing that causes
    <i>consumption</i>, you know!</p>

    <p><i>Unsc. V.</i> Then it's a pity he didn't leave it
    alone!</p>

    <h4><i>Before a Scene representing "The Home Life At
    Sandringham."</i></h4>

    <p><i>First Old Lady</i> (<i>with Catalogue</i>). It says here
    that "the note the page is handing <i>may</i> have come from
    Sir DIGHTON PROBYN, the Comptroller of the Royal Household"
    Fancy <i>that</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Second Old Lady</i>. He's brought it in in his fingers.
    Now <i>that</i>'s a thing I never allow in <i>my</i> house. I
    always tell SARAH to bring all letters, and even circulars, in
    on a tray!</p>

    <h4><i>Before a Scene representing the late</i> FRED ARCHER,
    <i>mounted, on Ascot Race-course.</i></h4>

    <p><i>A. Sportsman</i>. H'm&mdash;ARCHER, eh? Shouldn't have
    backed his mount in <i>that</i> race!</p>

    <h4><i>Before "The Library at Hawarden."</i></h4>

    <p><i>Gladstonian Enthusiast</i> (<i>to</i> Friend, <i>who,
    with the perverse ingenuity of patrons of Wax-works, has been
    endeavouring to identify the</i> Rev. JOHN WESLEY <i>among the
    Cabinet in Downing Street</i>). Oh, never mind all that lot,
    BETSY; they're only the <i>Gover'ment</i>! Here's dear Mr. and
    Mrs. GLADSTONE in this next! See, he's lookin' for something in
    a drawer of his side-board&mdash;ain't that <i>natural</i>? And
    only look&mdash;a lot of people have been leaving Christmas
    cards on him (<i>a pretty and touching tribute of affection,
    which is eminently characteristic of a warm-hearted
    Public</i>). I wish I'd thought o' bringing one with me!</p>

    <p><i>Her Friend</i>. So do I. We might send one 'ere by
    post&mdash;but it'll have to be a New Year Card now!</p>

    <p><i>A Strict Old Lady</i> (<i>before next group</i>). Who are
    these two? "Mr. 'ENERY IRVING, and Miss ELLEN TERRY in
    <i>Faust</i>," eh? No&mdash;I don't care to stop to see
    them&mdash;that's play-actin', that is&mdash;and I don't 'old
    with it nohow! What are these two parties supposed to be doin'
    of over here? What&mdash;Cardinal NEWMAN and Cardinal MANNING
    at the High Altar at the Oratory, Brompton! Come along, and
    don't encourage Popery by looking at such figures. I <i>did</i>
    'ear as they'd got Mrs. PEARCEY and the prambilator somewheres.
    I <i>should</i> like to see that, now.</p>

    <h3>IN THE CHILDREN'S GALLERY.</h3>

    <p><i>An Aunt</i> (<i>who finds the excellent Catalogue a mine
    of useful information</i>). Look, BOBBY, dear (<i>reading</i>).
    "Here we have CONSTANTINE'S Cat, as seen in the '<i>Nights of
    Straparola</i>,' an Italian romancist, whose book was
    translated into French in the year 1585&mdash;"</p>

    <p><i>Bobby</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Oh, then it <i>isn't</i>
    Puss in Boots!</p>

    <p><i>A Genial Grandfather</i> (<i>pausing before "Crusoe and
    Friday"</i>). Well, PERCY, my boy, you know who <i>that</i> is,
    at all events&mdash;eh?</p>

    <p><i>Percy</i>. I suppose it is STANLEY&mdash;but it's not
    very like.</p>

    <p><i>The G.G.</i> STANLEY!&mdash;Why, bless my soul, never
    heard of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and his man <i>Friday</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Percy</i>. Oh, I've <i>heard</i> of them, of
    course&mdash;they come in Pantomimes&mdash;but I like more
    grown-up sort of books myself, you know. Is this girl asleep
    <i>She</i>?</p>

    <p><i>The G.G.</i> No&mdash;at least&mdash;well, I expect it's
    "<i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>." You remember her, of
    course&mdash;all about the ball, and the glass slipper, and her
    father picking a rose when the hedge grew round the palace,
    eh?</p>

    <p><i>Percy</i>. Ah, you see, Grandfather, you had more time
    for general reading than we get. (<i>He looks through a
    practicable cottage window.</i>) Hallo, a Dog and a Cat. Not
    badly stuffed!</p>

    <p><i>The G.G.</i> Why that must be "<i>Old Mother
    Hubbard</i>." (<i>Quoting from memory.</i>) "Old Mother Hubbard
    sat in a cupboard, eating a Christmas pie&mdash;or a
    <i>bone</i> was it?"</p>

    <p><i>Percy</i>. Don't know. It's not in <i>Selections from
    British Poetry</i>, which we have to get up for "rep."</p>

    <p><i>The Aunt</i> (<i>reading from Catalogue</i>). "The absurd
    ambulations of this antique person, and the equally absurd
    antics of her dog, need no recapitulation." Here's "<i>Jack the
    Giant Killer</i>" next. Listen, BOBBY, to what it says about
    him here. (<i>Reads.</i>) "It is clearly the last transmutation
    of the old British legend told by GEOFFREY of Monmouth, of
    CORINEUS the Trojan, the companion of the Trojan BRUTUS, when
    he first settled in Britain. But more than this"&mdash;I hope
    you're listening, BOBBY?&mdash;"<i>more</i> than this, it is
    quite evident, even to the superficial student of Greek
    mythology, that many of the main incidents and ornaments are
    borrowed from the tales of HESIOD and HOMER." Think of that,
    now!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[BOBBY <i>thinks of it, with depression.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The G.G.</i> (<i>before figure of Aladdin's Uncle selling
    new lamps for old</i>). Here you are, you see! "<i>Ali
    Baba</i>," got 'em all here, you see. Never read your
    "<i>Arabian Nights</i>," either! Is that the way they bring up
    boys nowadays!</p>

    <p><i>Percy</i>. Well, the fact is, Grandfather, that unless a
    fellow reads that kind of thing when he's <i>young</i>, he
    doesn't get a chance afterwards.</p>

    <p><i>The Aunt</i> (<i>still quoting</i>). "In the famous
    work," BOBBY, "by which we know MASÛDI, he mentions the Persian
    Hezar Afsane-um-um-um,&mdash;nor have commentators failed to
    notice that the occasion of the book written for the Princess
    HOMAI resembles the story told in the Hebrew Bible about
    ESTHER, her mother or grandmother, by some Persian Jew two or
    three centuries B.C." Well, I never knew <i>that</i> before!...
    This is "<i>Sindbad and the Old Man of the Sea</i>"&mdash;let's
    see what they say about <i>him</i>. (<i>Reads.</i>) "Both the
    story of <i>Sindbad</i> and the old Basque legend of Tartaro
    are undoubtedly borrowed from the <i>Odyssey</i> of HOMER,
    whose <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> were translated into
    Syriac in the reign of HARUN-UR-RASHID." Dear, dear, how
    interesting, now! and, BOBBY, what <i>do</i> you think someone
    says about "<i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i>"? He says&mdash;"this
    tale is an allegory of the Teutonic Al-fader, the red hen
    representing the all-producing sun: the moneybags, the
    fertilising rain; and the harp, the winds." Well, I'm sure it
    seems likely enough, doesn't it?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[BOBBY <i>suppresses a yawn</i>; PERCY's <i>feelings are
        outraged by receiving a tin trumpet from the Lucky Tub;
        general move to the scene of the Hampstead Tragedy</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4><i>Before the Hampstead Tableaux.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Spectators</i>. Dear, dear, there's the <i>dresser</i>,
    you see, and the window, broken and all; it's wonderful how
    they can <i>do</i> it! And there's poor Mrs. 'OGG&mdash;it's
    real butter and a real loaf she's cutting, and the poor baby,
    too!... Here's the actual casts taken after they were murdered.
    Oh, and there's Mrs. PEARCEY wheeling the
    perambulator&mdash;it's the <i>very</i> perambulator! No, not
    the very one&mdash;they've got <i>that</i> at the other place,
    and the piece of toffee the baby sucked. Have they really! Oh,
    we <i>must</i> try and go there, too, before the children's
    holidays are over. And this is all? Well, well, everything very
    nice, I <i>will</i> say. But a pity they couldn't get the
    <i>real</i> perambulator!</p>

    <h2>OPERATIC GOSSIP.</h2>

    <p>During the preparation of Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN's new Opera,
    <i>Ivanhoe</i>, a grave objection to the subject occurred to
    him, which was, that one of the chief personages in the
    <i>dramatis personæ</i> must be "Gilbert"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
    <i>Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert</i>. True, that <i>Sir Brian</i>
    is the villain of the piece, but this, to Sir ARTHUR's generous
    disposition, only made matters worse. It was evident that he
    couldn't change the character's name to <i>Sir Brian de
    Bois-Sullivan</i>, and Mr. D'OYLEY CARTE refused to allow his
    name to appear in the bill except as Lessee. "I can't put him
    in simply as <i>Sir Brian</i>," said the puzzled Composer,
    "unless I make him an Irishman, and I don't think my librettist
    will consent to take this liberty with SCOTT's novel." "But the
    name in the Opera isn't pronounced the same as W.S.G.'s,"
    objected D'OYLEY. "It will be outside the Opera by ninety out
    of a hundred," answered Sir ARTHUR. "But," continued D'OYLEY,
    persistently, "it isn't spelt the same." "No," replied Sir
    ARTHUR, "that's the worst of it; there's 'u' and 'i' in it;
    we're both mixed up with this <i>Guilbert</i>." Fortunately,
    the Composer and the Author made up their quarrel, and as a
    memento of the happy termination to the temporary
    misunderstanding, Sir ARTHUR, in a truly generous mood,
    designed to call the character "<i>Sir Brian de
    Bois-Gilbert-and-Sullivan</i>." Whether the mysterious
    librettist, whose name has only lately been breathed in the
    public ear, insisted on SCOTT's original name being retained or
    not, it is now pretty certain that there will be no departure
    from the great novelist's original nomenclature.</p>

    <p>The excellent article in the <i>Times</i> on the 6th inst.
    upon CHARLES KEENE was worthy of its subject. The writer in the
    <i>P.M.G.</i> of a day earlier performed his self-imposed task
    with a judicious and loving hand, and, as far as I can judge,
    his account of our lamented colleague seems to be correct. As
    to our CARLO's Mastership in his Black-and-White Art, there can
    be but one opinion among Artists. Those who possess the whole
    of the <i>Once a Week</i> series will there find admirable
    specimens of CHARLES KEENE in a more serious vein. His most
    striking effects were made as if by sudden inspiration. I
    remember a story which exactly illustrates my meaning. An
    artistic friend was in KEENE's studio, while CARLO was at work,
    pipe in mouth, of course. "I can't understand," said his
    friend, "how you produce that effect of distance in so small a
    picture." "O&mdash;um&mdash;easy enough," replied KEENE. "Look
    here,"&mdash;and&mdash;<i>he did it</i>. But when and how he
    gave <i>the</i> touch which made the effect, his friend,
    following his work closely, was unable to discover. F.C.B.</p>

    from Dieppe to Nice ("Dieppend upon it, he found it very nice!"
    said Young PAR, regardless of propriety and pronunciation) by
    Mr. C.P. SAINTON. CHARLES COLLINS utilised such an expedition
    from a literary point of view in his inimitable "<i>Cruise upon
    Wheels</i>," and this young artist has turned similar
    wanderings to good artistic account. His <i>cartes de
    visite</i>&mdash;no, I beg pardon, his <i>caravans de
    visite</i>&mdash;are numerous and varied. Verily, my brethren,
    all is caravanity! Not altogether, for Mr. SAINTON, in addition
    to returning with his caravan and himself, has brought back an
    interesting collection of original and delicate works in oil
    and silver-point&mdash;in short, taken every caravantage of his

        accused of plagiarism. I reply that the accusation is
        ridiculous. Nature is the great plagiarist, the sucker of
        the brains of authors. There is no situation, however
        romantic or grotesque, which Nature does not sooner or
        later appropriate. Therefore the more natural an author is,
        the more liable is he to envious accusations of
        plagiarism.... Humour may often be detected in an absence
        of leg-coverings. A naval officer is an essentially
        humorous object.... As to literary style, it can be varied
        at pleasure, but the romantic Egyptian and the plain South
        African are perhaps best. In future my motto will be,
        '<i>Ars Langa Rider brevis</i>,' and a very good motto too.
        I like writing in couples. Personally I could never have
        bothered myself to learn up all these quaint myths and

    <p>My name is SMALLUN HALFBOY, a curious name for an old fellow
    like me, who have been battered and knocked about all over the
    world from Yorkshire to South Africa. I'm not much of a hand at
    writing, but, bless your heart, I know the <i>Bab Ballads</i>
    by heart, and I can tell you it's no end of a joke quoting them
    everywhere, especially when you quote out of an entirely
    different book. I am not a brave man, but nobody ever was a
    surer shot with an Express longbow, and no one ever killed more
    Africans, men and elephants, than I have in my time. But I do
    love blood. I love it in regular rivers all over the place,
    with gashes and slashes and lopped heads and arms and legs
    rolling about everywhere. Black blood is the best variety; I
    mean the blood of black men, because nobody really cares
    twopence about them, and you can massacre several thousands of
    them in half-a-dozen lines and offend no single soul. And,
    after all, I am not certain that black men have any souls, so
    that makes things safe all round, as someone says in the <i>Bab
    Ballads</i>.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>I was staying with my old friend Sir HENRY HURTUS last
    winter at his ancestral home in Yorkshire. We had been shooting
    all day with indifferent results, and were returning home
    fagged and weary with our rifles over our shoulders. I ought to
    have mentioned that COODENT&mdash;of course, you remember
    Captain COODENT, R.N.&mdash;was of the party. Ever since he had
    found his legs so much admired by an appreciative public, he
    had worn a kilt without stockings, in order to show them. This,
    however, was not done from vanity, I think, but rather from a
    high sense of duty, for he felt that those who happened to be
    born with personal advantages ought not to be deterred by any
    sense of false modesty from gratifying the reading public by
    their display. Lord, how we had laughed to see him struggling
    through the clinging brambles in Sir HENRY's coverts with his
    eye-glass in his eye and his Express at the trail. At every
    step his unfortunate legs had been more and more torn, until
    there was literally not a scrap of sound skin upon them
    anywhere. Even the beaters, a stolid lot, had roared when old
    VELVETEENS the second keeper had brought up to poor COODENT a
    lump of flesh from his right leg, which he had found sticking
    on a thorn-bush in the centre of the high covert. Suddenly Sir
    HENRY stopped and shaded his eyes with his hand anxiously. We
    all imitated him, though for my part, not being a sportsman, I
    had no notion what was up. "What's the time of day, Sir HENRY?"
    I ventured to whisper. Sir HENRY never looked at me, but took
    out his massive gold Winchester repeater and consulted it in a
    low voice. "Four thirty," I heard him say, "they are about
    due." Suddenly there was a whirring noise in the distance.
    "Duck, duck!" shouted Sir HENRY, now thoroughly aroused. I
    immediately did so, ducked right down in fact, for I did not
    know what might be coming, and I am a very timid man. At that
    moment I heard a joint report from Sir HENRY and COODENT. It
    gave on the whole a very favourable view of the situation, and
    by its light I saw six fine mallard, four teal and three
    widgeon come hurtling down, as dead as so many door-nails, and
    much heavier on the top of my prostrate body.</p>

    <p>When I recovered Sir HENRY was bending over me and pouring
    brandy down my throat. COODENT was sitting on the ground
    binding up his legs. "My dear old friend," said Sir HENRY, in
    his kindest tone, "this Yorkshire is too dangerous. My mind is
    made up. This very night we all start for Mariannakookaland.
    There at least our lives will be safe."</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>We were in Mariannakookaland. We had been there a month
    travelling on, ever on, over the parching wastes, under the
    scorching African sun which all but burnt us in our
    <i>treks</i>. Our <i>Veldt</i> slippers were worn out, and our
    pace was consequently reduced to the merest <i>Kraal</i>. At
    rare intervals during our adventurous march, we had seen Stars
    and heard of Echoes, but now not a single <i>Kopje</i> was
    left, and we were trudging along mournfully with our blistered
    <i>tongas</i> protruding from our mouths.</p>

    <p>Suddenly Sir HENRY spoke&mdash;"SMALLUN, my old friend," he
    said, "do you see anything in the distance?"</p>

    <p>I looked intently in the direction indicated, but could see
    nothing but the horizon. "Look again," said Sir HENRY. I swept
    the distance with my glance. It was a sandy, arid distance,
    and, naturally enough, a small cloud of dust appeared. Then a
    strange thing happened. The cloud grew and grew. It came
    rolling towards us with an unearthly noise. Then it seemed to
    be cleft in two, as by lightning, and from its centre came
    marching towards us a mighty army of Amazonian warriors, in
    battle-array, chanting the war-song of the Mariannakookas. I
    must confess that my first instinct was to fly, my second to
    run, my third, and best, to remain rooted to the spot. When the
    army came within ten yards of us, it stopped, as if by magic,
    and a stout Amazon, of forbidding aspect, who seemed to be the
    Commander-in-Chief, advanced to the front. On her head she wore
    an immense native jelibag, tricked out with feathers; her
    breast was encased in a huge silver <i>tureene</i>. Her waist
    was encircled with a broad girdle, in which were stuck all
    manner of deadly arms, <i>stuhpans, sorspans, spîhts</i>, and
    <i>deeshecloutz</i>. In her left hand she carried a
    deadly-looking <i>kaster</i>, while in her right she brandished
    a massive <i>rolinpin</i>, a frightful weapon, which produces
    internal wounds of the most awful kind. Her regiments were
    similarly armed, save that, in their case, the breast-covering
    was made of inferior metal, and they wore no feathers in their
    head-dress. The Commander held up her hand. Instantly the
    war-song ceased. Then the Commander addressed us, and her voice
    sounded like the song of them that address the
    <i>butchaboys</i> in the morning. And this was the
    <i>torque</i> she hurled at us,&mdash;</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>"Oh, wanderers from a far country, I am
    She-who-will-never-Obey, the Queen of the Mariannakookas. I
    rule above, and in nether regions, where there is Eternal Fire.
    Behold my Word goes forth, and the Ovens are made hot, and the
    <i>Kee-chen-boi-lars</i> are filled with Water. Over me no
    Mistress holds sway. All whom I meet I keep in subjection, save
    only the <i>Weeklibuks</i>; them I keep not down, for they
    delight me. And the land over which I reign is made glad with
    fat and much stored up <i>Dripn</i>. Who are ye, and what seek
    ye here? Speak ere it be too late!" And as she ceased the whole
    army broke forth into a chorus, "She-who-will-never-Obey has
    spoken! The Word is gone forth! Speak, speak!" I confess I was
    alarmed, and my fears were not diminished when two of the
    <i>Skulrimehds</i> (a sort of native camp-follower) came up to
    COODENT and me, and actually began to make love to us in the
    most forward manner. But Sir HENRY maintained his calm
    demeanour. "She-who-will-never-Obey," he said, "we are peaceful
    traders. We bring no Commission&mdash;" how his sentence would
    have ended will never be known. Certain it is that what he said
    roused the Amazons to a frenzy of passion. They yelled and
    danced round us. "He who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> brings no Commission must
       die!" they shouted; and in a moment we found ourselves bound
       tightly hand-and-foot, and marching as prisoners of war in
       the centre of the Mariannakookaland army.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

    <p>It is unnecessary to go through the details of our
    marvellous escape from the lowest dungeon of the royal Palace
    of SURVAN TSAUL, where for months we were immured on a constant
    diet of suet pudding. Of course we did escape, but only after
    killing ten thousand Mariannakookas, and then swimming for a
    mile in their blood. COODENT brought with him a very pretty
    <i>Skulrimehd</i> who had grown attached to him, but she
    drooped and pined away after he lost his false teeth in
    crossing a river, and tried to replace them with orange-peel, a
    trick he had learnt at school. Sir HENRY's fight with
    She-who-will-never-Obey is still remembered. He will carry the
    marks of her nails on his cheeks to his grave. I myself am
    tired of wandering. "<i>Home, Sweet Home</i>," as the <i>Bab
    Ballads</i> have it, is the place for me.</p>

            power.</p>

            <p>Last of all came <i>Burleybumbo</i> with his crew, a
            motley horde,</p>

            <p>Our old friend, Blacksmith JOHN, was in attendance
            on his lord.</p>

            <p>They were singing and carousing, when a man rushed
            in to say</p>

            <p>That a dozen wealthy travellers were coming down
            that way.</p>

            <p>The band dispersed, and hid themselves, in hopes
            that they might plunder</p>

            <p>The unsuspecting wayfarers. Alas! now came the
            blunder:</p>

            <p>Old JOHN he wouldn't hide himself, but coolly walked
            about</p>

            <p>Advancing to the footlights, he looked
            around&mdash;but hark! a shout:&mdash;</p>

            <p>"Confound you! Dash my&mdash;! Just come off! Hi,

            <p>"Not if I knowsh it, jolly old pal! I've only just
            come on!"</p>

            <p>Thus saying, he lumbered round the stage. The
            Prompter's heart had sunk:</p>

            <p>No doubt about the matter&mdash;<i>Burleybumbo's</i>
            man is drunk!</p>

            <p>"Come off! Come off!" from every wing was now the

            <p><i>Burleybumbo</i> then appeared, and vainly tried

            <p>JOHN stove his pasteboard head in with a most

            <p>Fair Maiden, you're looking a vision of beauty,</p>

            <p>You may comfort yourself you've no rival to
            fear;</p>

            <p>But you won't take it ill if I feel it my duty</p>

            <p>Or, at any rate, when it's more early than late,</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Publisher of <i>The Century Illustrated Monthly
    Magazine</i>, earnestly requests the reviewer, appealing to his
    heart in the reddest of red ink, on a slip of paper pasted on
    to the cover of the Magazine, not to extract and quote more
    than one column of "Talleyrand's Memoirs," which appear in this
    number for January. The Publisher of the <i>C.I.M.M.</i> does
    not appeal personally to the Baron&mdash;who is now the last,
    bar one, of the Barons, and that bar one is one at the
    Bar,&mdash;but, for all that, the Baron hereby and hereon takes
    his solummest Half-a-Davey or his entire Davey, that he will
    not write, engrave, or represent, or cause to be, &amp;c, for
    purposes of quotation, one single word, much less line, of
    <i>Tallyho</i>&mdash;beg pardon, of
    <i>Talleyrand</i>,&mdash;extracts from whose memoirs are now
    appearing in the aforesaid <i>C.I.M.M.</i> But all he will say
    at present is this, that, if the secret and private Memoirs
    haven't got in them anything more thrilling or startling, or
    out of the merest common-place, than appears in this number of
    the <i>C.I.M.M.</i>, then the Baron will say that he would
    prefer reading such contributions as M. de BLOWITZ's story of
    "How he became a Special," or <i>The Pigmies of the African
    Forest</i> by HENRY M. STANLEY in the same number of this
    Mag.</p>

    </div>

    <p>What the Baron dearly loves is, ELLIOT STOCK-IN-TRADE <i>The
    Book-worm</i>, always most interesting to Book-worms, and
    almost as interesting to Book-grubs or Book-butterflies. By the
    way, the publishing office of <i>The Book-worm</i> ought to be
    in Grub Street. For what sort of fish is <i>The Book-worm</i>
    an attractive bait? I suppose there are queer fish in the Old
    Book trade that can take in any number of Book-worms, as is
    shown from a modern instance, well and wisely commented upon in
    this very number for January, No. 38, which is excellent food
    for worms; the whole series, indeed, must be a very Diet of
    Worms. Success to the <i>Book-worm</i>! May it grow to double
    the size, and be a glow-worm, to enlighten us in the bye-paths
    of literature. "<i>Prosit!</i>" says the Baron.</p>

    <p>I would that some one would write of BROWNING's work as
    HENRY VAN DYKE has written of TENNYSON's. To the superficial
    and cursory reader of the Laureate, the Baron, sitting by the
    fire on a winter's night, the wind howling over the sea, and
    the snow drifting against the window, and being chucked in
    handfuls down the chimney, and frizzling on the fire, says, get
    this book, published by ELKIN MATHEWS: <i>ça donne à
    penser</i>, and this is its great merit. "Come into the Garden,
    Maud"&mdash;no, thank you, not to-night; but give me my
    shepherd's pipe, with the fragrant bird's-eye in it, with
    [Greek: ton grogon], while I sit by the cheerful fire, in the
    best of good company&mdash;my books.</p>

    <p>Our Mr. GRIFFITHES (CHESTER, MAYHEW, BROOME, AND GRIFFITHES)
    has been all the way <i>From Bedford Row to Swazieland</i>, and
    has written a lively narrative of his perilous journey. He went
    on a professional retainer. You don't catch Bedford Row in
    Swazieland on other terms. Being there, he kept his eyes open,
    saw a good deal, and describes his impressions in racy fashion.
    He did not like the coffee served <i>en route</i>, and was
    disappointed with the Southern Cross; but on the whole enjoyed
    the trip. One would naturally expect that the price of his book
    would be six-and-eight-pence, or, regarding it in the form of a
    letter, three-and-fourpence, but BRADBURY, AGNEW, &amp; Co.
    issue it at a shilling.</p>

    <h2>THE SHAH (LEFEVRE) AND THE SULTAN.</h2>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:45%;">
        <a href="images/35.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>Over a series of weeks preceding Christmas, Europe was
    disturbed by rumours of a momentous interview reported to have
    taken place on the banks of the unsuspecting Bosphorus. One of
    the parties to the conference was his Imperial Majesty the
    SULTAN. The other was an English Statesman, the trusted
    counsellor of an Ex-Premier, and believed in family circles to
    be the real author of some of his supreme measures. The
    naturally retiring disposition of the Statesman in question,
    and his inviolable reticence in respect of any matter
    concerning himself, made it difficult to arrive at the truth.
    Doubtless the stupendous event&mdash;the possible consequences
    of which on European affairs Time will work out&mdash;would
    have remained for ever hidden but for the ruthless action of
    "the London Correspondents of various provincial papers, who
    gave in their London letters more or less inaccurate reports of
    the event." How they came to know anything about it admits of
    only one conclusion. <i>The SULTAN must have told them</i>. The
    event was too important to be left to this haphazard kind of
    record, and, accordingly, the <i>Speaker</i> has been favoured
    with a narrative of what took place, the signature disclosing
    the fact that the other party to the interview was the SHAH
    LEFEVRE.</p>

    <p>The SHAH's account, regarded as a record of a historical
    event, is manifestly hampered by that modest and insatiable
    desire for self-effacement which marks this eminent man. We see
    anonymous "persons who had access to the SULTAN approaching"
    the SHAH, and "suggesting to him that he ought to apply for an
    audience." We see him "declining to do so on the ground that,
    having taken an active part in the agitation in England on the
    subject of the Bulgarian atrocities in 1877, it would not be
    right that I should thrust myself on the attention of the
    SULTAN." It is generally thought at Stamboul and elsewhere that
    Mr. GLADSTONE was chiefly responsible for the memorable
    agitation referred to. But the SHAH is not the man to hide the
    truth. Also, "I wished to be free to say what I thought about
    the condition of Turkey on my return to England." That was only
    fair to waiting England. No use the SULTAN trying to "nobble"
    this relentless man. So it came to pass that he went to the
    Palace, reluctant, but "feeling we could not refuse such a
    command from the Sovereign of the country." He talked with
    CHAKIR PACHA and WAHAN EFFENDI; saw the SULTAN's horse; hung
    about for hours; no SULTAN appeared; went back to hotel
    quivering under the insult. Had framed telegram ordering the
    British Fleet to the Bosphorus, when VAMBÉRY turned up, pale
    and trembling; besought the SHAH to do nothing rash; explained
    it was all a mistake. This followed up by invitation to dine at
    the Palace the following day.</p>

    <p>All this, and what followed at the dinner; how there were
    "excellent wines, electric lights, and a great display of
    plate"; how the SULTAN, concentrating his attention on the
    SHAH, and forgetful of poor FREDERICK HARRISON, who had,
    somehow, been elbowed into obscurity, paid court to this
    powerful personality; how he received him on the daïs, and now
    cunningly, though ineffectually, he endeavoured to secure on
    the spot the evacuation of Egypt, is told in the SHAH'S
    delicious narrative.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Punch</i>, sharing in the thrilling interest this
    disclosure has created throughout the civilised world, has been
    anxious to complete the record by supplementing the SHAH's
    account of the interview, with the SULTAN's own version. This
    was, at the outset, difficult. Obstacles were thrown in the
    way, but they were overcome by the pertinacity and ingenuity of
    Our Representative, who at last found himself seated with the
    SULTAN on the very daïs from which SHAH LEFEVRE had conferred
    with his Imperial Majesty whilst other of the forty guests,
    "including the Austrian Ambassador," looked on, green with
    envy.</p>

    <p>"It's a curious thing," said the SULTAN, laying down a book
    he had been reading when Our Representative entered, "that,
    when you were announced, I had just come upon a reference by
    your great Poet to your still greater Statesman. You know the
    line in Lockandkey Hall,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"'Oh the dreary, drear LEFEVRE! Oh the barren,
            barren SHAW!'"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"That," Our Representative writes, "is not precisely the
    line as I remember it; but I make it a rule never to correct a
    SULTAN."</p>

    <p>Accordingly His Majesty proceeded: "And so, my good Cousin,
    <i>Mr. Punch</i>, wants to know all about this interview, the
    <i>bruit</i> of which has shaken the Universe. His wishes are
    commands to me. In the first place, I will tell you (though
    this is not for publication), that it was by the merest
    accident I had the advantage of knowing your great countryman.
    I heard there had come to Constantinople one FREDERICK
    HARRISON, head of a sect called the Positivists. I am, you
    know, in my way, and within the limits of my kingdom, one of
    the most absolute Positivists of the age. I wanted to see the
    English apostle, and told them to ask him to dinner. Somehow
    things got mixed up, and, at the preliminary morning call, the
    SHAH LEFEVRE walked in. Had never heard of him before, but
    gathered from CHAKIR PACHA, who had been talking to WAHAN
    EFFENDI, who, had seen WOODS PACHA, who had spent an hour with
    VAMBÉRY, upon whom SHAH LEFEVRE had called, that the SHAH was
    really the mainspring of the Liberal Party in England,
    GLADSTONE being merely figure-head, HARCOURT in his pay, and
    CHAMBERLAIN suffering in exile under his displeasure. Allah is
    Good! Here was a chance thrown into my hands. I forgot all
    about FREDERICK HARRISON; told CHAKIR PACHA and WAHAN EFFENDI
    to entertain the SHAH in the ante-chamber with coffee and
    cigarettes, drawing him out on Armenia and Egypt. Meanwhile I
    crept under the sofa, and heard every word. The SHAH very stern
    about Armenia, could not be drawn about Egypt. At end of hour
    and half began to get tired under sofa; managed to stick in
    WAHAN EFFENDI's Wellington boot a note, on which I had written,
    'Take him to see my horse.' So they went off to stable, and, as
    soon as coast was clear, I crept out; shut myself up in room
    for rest of day. Heard afterwards that they came back, the SHAH
    much impressed with appearance of my horse; resumed
    conversation on Armenia and Egypt for another hour; at last got
    rid of SHAH.</p>

    <p>"At night VAMBÉRY, disguised as melon-seller, entered Palace
    and gained access to my room. Told me fearful mess had been
    made of matters. The SHAH really didn't care about seeing the
    horse; wanted to see me. Talks about ordering round the Fleet.
    'Better ask him to dinner,' said VAMBÉRY; so despatched Grand
    Chamberlain in carriage and six. The SHAH mollified; gave him a
    good dinner: plenty of electric lights. Afterwards he was good
    enough to see me on the daïs. Tried to get him to promise
    alteration in attitude of English Liberal Party towards me;
    also wanted him to settle at once withdrawal of troops from
    Egypt, But, though most urbane in manner, exceedingly cautious.
    Not to be drawn. Talk about Eastern statecraft! nothing to you
    English, as represented by jour SHAH LEFEVRES. When I pressed
    him to come to point about Egypt, he said, 'On this subject I
    can only speak my own views. I am not authorised to speak on
    behalf of those I am politically associated with, but
    personally I am opposed to the occupation of Egypt by English
    troops.' There's an answer for you! Your MACHIAVELLIS, your
    TALLEYRANDS not in it. Felt I had wasted some time, and given
    away a dinner all for nothing, except the memory that will ever
    rest with me of having been privileged to see this remarkable
    man standing on my daïs."</p>

    <p>Here the SULTAN clapped his hands three times, and Our
    Representative, being carefully placed in a sack, was dropped
    into the Bosphorus, whence he was rescued in time to send off
    this despatch for publication in the current Number.</p>

    <h2>THE AMUSING RATTLE'S TOPICAL NOTEBOOK.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>For the Use of Diners-out and other Amateur
    Entertainers.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>The Strike in Scotland</i>.&mdash;You might suggest, that
    were it in Ireland, one might see a <i>rail</i> way out of it,
    or rather in it. This jest may be expected to be appreciated by
    a parson's wife of the sharper sort. Something ought to be got
    out of the visit of the agitator BURNS to the North. Example of
    what can be done in this direction:&mdash;"People who play with
    fire (persons who go in for strikes) must expect BURNS."
    However, be careful not to say this to a Scotchman, or he may
    want your blood before you get to the cigarettes. North Britons
    are very jealous of the reputation of their national poet, and
    permit no jokes upon the subject. You see, in letting off your
    witticism at a Scotchman, you would have to explain that it
    <i>was</i> a joke. You might also hint that it was "hard lines"
    for the Railway Companies concerned; but this will provoke
    gloom rather than gaiety amongst those who have invested in
    Caledonians and North British. If you talk about the riots in
    connection with the movement, you might say that the pugnacious
    rioters remind you of safety matches, "for they not only
    strike, but strike on the box!"</p>

    <p><i>The Parnell Negociations in France</i>.&mdash;You can say
    something about O'BRIEN's invitation to Mr. PARNELL to pay him
    an evening visit on the French coast, reminds you of the once
    popular song, "<i>Meet me by Moonlight, Boulogne</i>." If you
    are told that "Boulogne" should be "Alone," return,
    "Precisely&mdash;borrowed a word&mdash;Boulogne was a loan."
    This ought to go with roars. At a Smoking Concert you might
    suggest that Mr. O'BRIEN was just the man to settle a quarrel,
    because even when he was in prison he took an absorbing
    interest in <i>the proper adjustment of breeches</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The Row at the Post Office</i>.&mdash;As the Savings'
    Bank Department has for years been the Cinderella of the Civil
    Service, this is a subject that will not create much interest;
    however, you might possibly extract a pleasantry out of the
    name of the present Postmaster-General in connection with the
    now-appeased <i>employés</i>. With a little trouble you should
    be able to say something quite sparkling about what the
    "officers" <i>hoe</i> to <i>Raikes</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The Portuguese Difficulty in Africa</i>.&mdash;Rather a
    good subject at a Christmas Dinner, where relatives (on
    particularly affectionate and intimate terms) are gathered
    together. Say you have got to the dessert, and you start the
    subject. Observe that it is fortunate that the SULTAN OF TURKEY
    is not interested in the matter, or there would be further
    trouble of a like character. To the question, "Why?" reply,
    taking up a bottle of red wine to point your witticism, "would
    it not be a second difficulty with the <i>Porte, you
    geese</i>?" To make the jest perfect, connect Turkey in Europe
    with the <i>dindon aux marrons</i>, of which you will have just
    partaken.</p>

    <p><i>The Weather</i>.&mdash;If forced to fall back upon this
    venerable subject (which should only be broached in the wilds
    of Cornwall, or other equally primitive spots), of course you
    can speak of a hard frost being "<i>an ice</i> day for a
    hunting-man, although he is sure to swear at it." If the
    weather breaks, you may observe, "<i>You thaw so</i>," but not
    when you have to shout the quibble through the ear-trumpet of a
    deaf old maid. And this, with the other witticisms recorded
    above, should carry you (by desire) into the middle of next
    week.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
